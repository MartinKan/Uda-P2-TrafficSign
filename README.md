## Udacity - Traffic Sign Classification Project - Submission

Overview
---

This repository contains the following files that I will be submitting for the traffic sign classification project:

1.  P1.ipynb 
2.  writeup_template.md

The first file is the jupyter notebook that contains the code I have written for the project and the second file is the write up of my reflections and explanations on the project code. 

My code allows lane lines to be detected in both still and moving images.  A further explanation on how it works can be found in the write up.

The repository contains other files and folders apart from the 2 files mentioned above.  They are the binary images and movies that were included in the starter kit which I used to test my code.

To run my code, the Anaconda environment described in the starter kit must be first set up and be activated.  The corresponding image and movie files referenced in the code must be stored in the correct locations.  Then the jupyter notebook can be loaded from a browser and run correctly.
