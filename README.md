## Udacity - Traffic Sign Classification Project - Submission

Overview
---

This repository contains the following files that I will be submitting for the traffic sign classification project:

1.  [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/MartinKan/Uda-P2-TrafficSign/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)
2.  [report.html](https://github.com/MartinKan/Uda-P2-TrafficSign/blob/master/report.html)
2.  [project_writeup.md](https://github.com/MartinKan/Uda-P2-TrafficSign/blob/master/project_writeup.md)
3.  Various image fils that are referenced in project_writeup.md

The first two files contain the code I have written for the project.  The first file presents the code in jupyter notebook format and the second file presents the code in html format.

The third file is a written report for my project that addresses each of the rubric points for the project. 

My code contains a deep learning network that can be trained to classify images of German traffic signs with a high level of certainty.  A further explanation on how it works can be found in the write up.

To run my code, the Anaconda environment described in the starter kit must be first set up and be activated.  The corresponding training data and images referenced in the code must be stored in the correct locations.  Then the jupyter notebook can be loaded from a browser and run correctly.  For reasons that I have not yet fully understood, the Kernel will need to be restarted each time the code is ran, otherwise an exception would occur in the code.
